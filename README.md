## Description
The application is a simple, real-time forum for students. Users can only access the forums once logged in. If they are not logged in, users can see a list of currently active users and a list of subjects within the forum

Once logged in via a Google account, users are free to post new threads for discussion. Each thread must have a subject, which can be picked from the existing list or created. The main thread list can be filtered by a search query or selected subject, and can be sorted by date posted or popularity.

Within a thread, users can view a list of all comments that have been posted on that thread. Each comment displays the user who posted it, their Google profile picture, the date of submission and the comment itself. New comments can be added by logged in users.
